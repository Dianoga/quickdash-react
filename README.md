This is my own *very* custom dashboard for SmartThings. It makes use of a custom SmartApp to store data in Firebase. The basic goal is to provide a quick overview of your house status. You can also drill down into each contact, motion, and switch sensor to see individual statuses. For switches and the door control, you can click on them to toggle (door open/close, switch on/off).
